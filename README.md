# Image-Generation-using-stable-diffusion-Comfy-UI-session
## Overview
This project explores AI-based image generation using Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI. Stable Diffusion is a deep-learning model that generates high-quality images from text prompts, while ComfyUI provides a modular and user-friendly interface to fine-tune the process.

This work was completed as part of the AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning under TechSaksham â€“ A joint CSR initiative of Microsoft & SAP.

### Features
- Text-to-Image Generation: Generate images from textual descriptions.
- Customizable Parameters: Adjust Stable Diffusion settings via ComfyUI.
- Iterative Denoising: Enhances image quality through multiple refinement steps.
- Post-processing Enhancements: Apply sharpening, style changes, and improvements.
- Super-Resolution Techniques: Increase image resolution for high-quality outputs.
- Real-time Generation: Optimized inference for faster results.

### Project Workflow
- User Input: Provide a textual prompt and parameters.
- ComfyUI Processing: The input is structured and prepared for diffusion.
- Stable Diffusion Model: Generates the base image.
- Iterative Denoising: The model refines details progressively.
- Post-processing & Enhancements: Apply final improvements.
- User Review & Modifications: Evaluate and adjust the image if needed.
